# Django example

## Getting Started

It's as easy as...

1. Install [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
2. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the app server!

```
python manage.py runserver
```
4. The API will become available at localhost:8000
5. Changes made in this folder will automatically reload your code
